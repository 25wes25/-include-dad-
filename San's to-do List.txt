These are the following things I need:
Background:
Due to the fact that Shape is no longer going to be inheriting from QPainter, 
rather it will be a container for data that will be used for QPainter inputs, it is necessary for us to 
get inputs from mainInterface into the canvas class. However for things like: 
Qt::brushStyle 
Qt::Global Color
Qt::penJoinStyle
etc...
we need to have member functions that convert the index integer inputs from Main interface, to Qt enums.
I have already done a few for example, and you can find the relavant values for the enums here.

 http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qt.html#GlobalColor-enum

What I need is for people to write conversion methods (int to enum)
and Accessors and Mutators associated with these Qt:; enums that have become part of our Shape class.

Also keep an eye out for some errors I think I may have committed:
The Following functions need to be virtual in ALL of classes that are children of Shape

virtual void move(QPoint &xy)=0;
virtual void move(int x , int y)=0;
virtual void resize(double x)=0;
virtual void Draw(Canvas *paintArea)=0;
virtual bool is_Left_Clicked(QPoint &e)=0;


#3
Feel free to look at my already done
virtual void Draw(Canvas *paintArea)=0;
and try to implement to the other classes that do not yet have a draw function. 
However, Please leave polyline to me.

Probably the thing we should get done first.
